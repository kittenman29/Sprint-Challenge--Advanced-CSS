1.  Adaptive websites use hard coded pixels for height and width       and don't change when your window size of the page is changing.
    Responsive websites are fluid when you are changing the window size of the viewport.

2.  Mobile first is designing the website for a mobile phone           viewport first and then adding larger media query breakpoints      for larger tablet and desktop views. 

    Desktop first is the opposite of that starting with desktop.

3.  It converts 1rem into 10px.

4.  It allows the CSS to be nested for easier writing and              structuring of the code.  It also helps with less lag when you     load a website becuase the CSS is already at runtime.

5.  The syntax of nested media queries is tough to get used to.  The modular layout of the nesting is really nice for finding where you are in your code.
